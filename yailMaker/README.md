### Things Not Included in the current iteration
- charts and charts data - could not get them to work on emulator using MIT App Inventor so did not include
- FirebaseDb - there are some fixed default values so would require special processing code for this component and I am a bit over adding components at the moment (being doing it every day for a week)

### TODO

[x] Make sure only valid nesting of items can occue (ignore/error out)
[ ] CSS type external styling
[ ] Programming language documentation for functionality
[ ] Validate components for the 'setComponent' function 
[ ] Complete this readme
[ ] Compilation to android app (unlikely)


### Known Issues Properties (For Setting)

Feature collection has some issues. These will be worked out one day.
Essentially, you can load from URL and need to use file and web components to import data and load it one element at a time using featureFromDescription.
Source property removed (for now)
