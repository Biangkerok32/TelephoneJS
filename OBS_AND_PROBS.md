PROBLEMS


PROBLEM 1:

PROBLEM 2:

PROBLEM 3:
camera and camcorder throw errors on console but seem to work

PROBLEM 4:
ball component needs all methods to be tested, anything except bounce has not been tested

PROBLEM 5

FeatureFromDescription and
Save

PROBLEM 6
feature collection = everything

PROBLEM 7

PROBLEM 8

PROBLEM 9

PROBLEM 10

PROBLEM 11
emulatorUSb needs to have better file on device checking - at moment seems to upload everything each time (which works and is fine but annoying)



There is no way for me to test the following component properly - they may or may not work
Barometer
GyroscopeSensor
Hygrometer
Twitter - no account so no testing
