component heights and widths can only be read after a screen is initialized, otherwise they return zero
InstantInTime means milliseconds since epoch (1,1,1970 midnight)

PROBLEMS

PROBLEM 1:
Texting component can't send or recieve - it is the same problem in the offical app inventor to do with google permission. https://community.appinventor.mit.edu/t/error-908-permission-receive-sms/7426/5 

PROBLEM 2:
camera and camcorder throw errors on console but seem to work

PROBLEM 4
test navigation component by getting API key

PROBLEM 5
fail gracefully but not terminate on xml and js errors in code

PROBLEM 6
xml hinting dtd template?

PROBLEM 7
emulatorUSb needs to have better file on device checking - at moment seems to upload everything each time (which works and is fine but annoying)




There is no way for me to test the following component properly - they may or may not work
Barometer
GyroscopeSensor
Hygrometer
Twitter - no account so no testing
