Things not implemented:

String.codePointAt(0)
String.fromCodePoint()
String.prototype.localeCompare()

String.prototype.match()    //regex
String.prototype.matchAll()    //regex
String.prototye.normalize()

String.raw


String.prototype.replace acts slightly differently. When you add an object it flattens the object and prints it as opposed to printing [OBJECT object]. Maybe this is an improvement?

there is NO continue -> don't know how to implement this in Scheme
